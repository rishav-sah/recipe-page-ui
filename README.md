## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I undertook this challenge mainly to re-engage with coding after a gap of a couple of months. While this task is relatively beginner-friendly, I firmly believe that revisiting fundamental concepts is essential, especially when diving back into more advanced topics.

One noteworthy learning from the CSS portion is the :not(:last-child) selector, which targets elements that are not the last child within their parent element. Additionally, I recommend fellow developers to cultivate a strong understanding of CSS specificity.

```css
.nutrition-table tr:not(:last-child) th,
.nutrition-table tr:not(:last-child) td {
  border-bottom: 1px solid var(--light-grey); 
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to focus on dynamic projects using plain HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript to reinforce my understanding of the basics. I also aim to undertake larger-scale projects involving frameworks and libraries.
